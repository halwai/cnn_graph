input
--- for each data point a graph and the coreesponding signal on the graph
--- a graph on the data point is a (knn or fully connected) on in its neighbours for (M) neighbors we get ---> M*M matrix per data-point
--- a signal on such a graph is the all labels of its neighbours , for 'L' labels we get M*L matrix  per data-point

ouput
--- multilabels as in matrix (0 for absence and vice-versa) representation


experiments
--- different NN architectures --- > TODO
--- different K in KNN (store this rather than recomputing every time)
--- use FASIS for fast search and diverse labels
--- fc6 features/ fc7 features / fc5 features
--- normalize the input data
--- hypergraph
--- only knn graph (not fully connected)
